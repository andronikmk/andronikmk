## 👋 About Me

I graduated from New York University 16' with a B.A. in Individualized Studies. At NYU Gallatin, I successfully defended my colloquium titled The Evolution of Mind and Consciousness to my panel of academic advisors Dr. Peder Anker, Dr. Matthew Stanley and Dr. Rahul Hamid. 

A few years later, I learned about BloomTech’s Data Science program and immediately became  interested. I decided to enroll as full-time student in 19’. I feel in love with the interdisciplinary approach data scientists use to solve difficult problem and decided this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. My favorite topics include natural language processing, deep learning and predictive modeling.

Currently, I’m working as an Artificial Intelligence Research Engineer at Lockheed Martin and pursuing a post-bacc in Computer Science from OSU. My hobbies outside of Data Science include reading, physical fitness, and cooking.
