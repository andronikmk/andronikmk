## 👋 About Me

I graduated from New York University 16' with a B.A. in Individualized Studies. At NYU Gallatin, I successfully defended my colloquium on The Evolution of Mind and Consciousness to my academic advisors and panel members Dr. Peder Anker, Dr. Matthew Stanley and Dr. Rahul Hamid. At UF College of Medicine, I worked in the Kasahara Lab on understanding the function of Nkx2.5 in the Department of Physiology and Genomics.

When I learned that the Data Science program at Lambda School was enrolling students, I decided to take a risk and enroll full-time. Data Science is an opportunity to combine my interdisciplinary skill set to effect a positive change in the world. Currently, my favorite topics include natural language processing, object detection and effective data visualization. Occasionally, I publish articles on Medium, but in the future I will be publishing exclusively to the Articles section page on my website.

My hobbies outside of Data Science include reading, personal fitness, nutrition, and Criterion Collection. I enjoy reading about the history of philosophy, epistemology and philosophy of mind. My two favorite books are A History of Civilizations by Fernand Braudel and I Am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. In addition, I like to play tennis and go to the gym to stay active. The last great movie I watched was The Seventh Seal by Ingmar Bergman.
